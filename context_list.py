'''Perhaps no company embodies the ups and downs of Chinese big tech better than its biggest tech firm of all — Tencent. \
Two years ago the online empire seemed unstoppable. More than a billion Chinese were using its ubiquitous services to pay, play and do much else besides. \
Its video games, such as “League of Legends”, were global hits. \
Tencent’s market value exceeded $900bn, and the firm was on track to become China’s first trillion-dollar company. \
Then the Communist Party said, enough. \
Xi Jinping, China’s paramount leader, decided that big tech’s side-effects, from distracted teenagers to the diversion of capital from strategically important sectors such as semiconductors, were unacceptable. \
Tencent was, along with the rest of China’s once-thriving digital industry, caught up in a sweeping 18-month crackdown.  '''

'''It might have been a one-off. svb’s business—banking for techies—was unusual. \
Most clients were firms, holding in excess of the $250,000 protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (fdic), a regulator. \
If the bank failed they faced losses. And svb used deposits to buy long-dated bonds at the peak of the market. \
“One might have supposed that Silicon Valley Bank would be a good candidate for failure without contagion,” says Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary. \
Nevertheless, withdrawal requests at other regional banks in the following days showed “there was in fact substantial contagion.'''

The rain had continued for a week and the flood had created a big river which were running by Nancy Brown's farm. \
As she tried to gather her cows to a higher ground, she slipped and hit her head on a fallen tree trunk.\
The fall made her unconscious for a moment or two. When she came to, Lizzie, one of her oldest and favorite cows, was licking her face. \
At that time, the water level on the farm was still rising. Nancy gathered all her strength to get up and began walking slowly with Lizzie. \
The rain had become much heavier, and the water in the field was now waist high. \
Nancy's pace got slower and slower because she felt a great pain in her head. Finally, all she could do was to throw her arm around Lizzie's neck and try to hang on. \
About 20 minutes later, Lizzie managed to pull herself and Nancy out of the rising water and onto a bit of high land, which seemed like a small island in the middle of a lake of white water. \
Even though it was about noon, the sky was so dark and the rain and lightning was so bad that it took rescuers more than two hours to discover Nancy. \
A man from a helicopter lowered a rope, but Nancy couldn't catch it. A moment later, two men landed on the small island from a ladder in the helicopter. \
They raised her into the helicopter and took her to the school gym, where the Red Cross had set up an emergency shelter. \
When the flood disappeared two days later, Nancy immediately went back to the "island." Lizzie was gone. \
She was one of 19 cows that Nancy had lost in the flood. "I owe my life to her," said Nancy with tears.
